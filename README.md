# EN2550-Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing-Assigments

This repository is for assignments in the module EN 2550. In this assigment I have designed a linear classifier, a two layer fully connected network with hidden nodes, used stochastic gradient descent and constructed a CNN. The images I obtained by running the code are included in the folder '.a04_180411K/figures'. 

I have used python and visual studio to implement my code.
