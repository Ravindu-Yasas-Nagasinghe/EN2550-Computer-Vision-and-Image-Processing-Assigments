# EN2550-Computer-Vision-and-Image-Processing-Assigments
This repository is for assignments in the module EN 2550. In this assigment 4 I have designed a linear classifier, a two layer fully connected network with hidden nodes, used stochastic gradient descent and constructed a CNN. The images I obtained by running the code are included in the folder 'figures'. I have used python and visual studio to implement my code.
